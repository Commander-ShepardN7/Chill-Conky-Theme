# Chill-Conky-Theme
New original theme for Conky

# Setting preferences and widgets

You'll need to manually set some stuff

- Chill (Main theme)
1. Weather and forecast: grab your OpenWeather CityID and API Key and paste them in the  ```weather-v2.o.sh``` file

-Chill Music
1. Local music thumbnail: if you have local music, then paste each of your saved albums' album cover and rename them accordingly ```Name_of_the_Album```. It is case sensitive, and blanks must be separated by underscores.
2. Spotify Flatpak: if you're using a flatpak version of Spotify, be sure to use Flatseal to enable D-bus session and system buses, or else it will lag the theme atrociously

- Chill Mail
1. Gmail:Go to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en and follow instructions (you'll ned to enable 2-step verification on your Google account). Copy the 16-digit password (delete blank spaces), go to the ```gmail.sh``` file and replace with your credentials

- Chill Cal and App (appointments)
1. You need calcurse, as metioned above, to use this
